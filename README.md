In this project, we mostly see the air quality prediction by using machine learning approaches to predict the concentration of the ai pollutant in every hour. The air pollutant like O3, particle matter (PM 2.5,PM10), Sulphur dioxide (SO2), Nitrogen dioxide (NO2), Ammonia (NH3), Lead (Pb), CO. Machine learning is one of the most popular techniques and is able to trained the module on the big data by the use of the many algorithm. In this project, we planned refined model to predict the air pollution hour by hour and check the concentration of the air pollutant on the basis of the meteorological data of the past days by preparing over 24h as the multitask learning problem (MTL). We plan the regularization by implementing the model prediction in every hour to be close to each other and compare it with different regularization of the multitask learning (MTL) including other approach to compare the data and to predict the quality of the air. Our experiment by using the algorithm of the machine learning like Random forest theorem and Extra tree Regression, Lasso Regression, Linear Regression that is used to help in the comparison of the different data and make it efficient and accurate analysis of the data. By using the help of these algorithm of the machine learning we can easily find out the air quality index.
